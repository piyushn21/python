In Python, numbers are represented in various forms:

Integers (int): These are whole numbers without any decimal point. For example: 5, -10, 1000.

Floating-point numbers (float): These are numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form. For example: 3.14, 2.71828, 1.0e-5.

Complex numbers: These are numbers with a real and imaginary part expressed as a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. For example: 3 + 4j.
# Addition
result = 5 + 3.2
print(result)  # Output: 8.2

Floating-point numbers (float): These are numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form. For example: 3.14, 2.71828, 1.0e-5.
